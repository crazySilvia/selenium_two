### Task 2 “JSON check”
When you call this url
https://flapotest.blob.core.windows.net/test/ProductData.json
you will see a json file containing some of our products.<br>
Question: How would you proof in an automated way that the format of this json and
relations between entities have not been surprisingly changed?

### Answer:
I would install a suitable plugin like https://extensions.panic.com/extensions/ashur/ashur.JSONLint/ which automatically checks the JSON files.
If this does not lead to the desired goal, I would google further or ask experienced colleagues for advice.
